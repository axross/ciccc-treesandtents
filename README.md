## Development Workflows

### Take a Task

1. Choose and open an issue (as task) on the "To Do" column
2. Set assignee to you
3. Link the pull request you make to the issue

### Push the Changes

1. Checkout to a new branch
2. Commit the changes there
3. Push the branch to "remote" (this GitHub repository)
4. Create a new pull request
   - It's fine even if you didn't finish what you want to do. In this case, it's appropriate to create it as a "draft" pull request
   - **You must make sure code that will be merged to master branch work correctly**
5. Set someone as a reviewer and ask him/her to review the changes with a comment
6. (Reviewer) Review the changes and do "approve" or "request change"
   - Approve: when you don't find any problem or question
   - Request change: when you find some problem or question
     - You should leave comments in the review
7. After the reviewer approved, you will merge the pull request to merge. You **should use "Squash and merge"** instead of just "Merge pull request"

### Discuss

It's pretty much better to discuss it on a GitHub issue if you have anything you want to talk or make sure. Because it's really hard to find later things talked in a chat application.
